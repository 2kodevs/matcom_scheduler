# Matcom Scheduler
School project to manage and organize the exams calendar.

## Description 📋
If you are looking for a tool to create a calendar organization, or simply to decide the order of some options by using a voting system, then this project is for you ;-).

We use a Telegram bot for this task. This bot provide a simple mechanism to create discussions and vote, also you have some models available to select in order to reach different types of results.

## Execution ▶️
If you want to run your bot and you are done with the [set-up](https://github.com/2kodevs/matcom_scheduler/wiki/Setting-up), then execute:
```
make run
```
If you don't have `make` in your system just use:
```
python main.py
```
Also check the program help, to know about their available arguments:
```
pyhton main.py --help
```

## Customization 🔧
If you feel that the models are not fulfilling your excpectations, then you can read about how to create and use your own models in our [wiki](https://github.com/2kodevs/matcom_scheduler/wiki/Model).

Also you can personalize your bot, and again to know how to do that we recommend you to read our [wiki](https://github.com/2kodevs/matcom_scheduler/wiki/Introduction-to-the-bot#handlers).
