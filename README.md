# Matcom Scheduler
School project to manage and organize the exams calendar.

## Description
If you are looking for a tool to create a calendar organization, or simply to decide the order of some options by using a voting system, then this project is for you ;-).

We use a Telegram bot for this task. This bot provide a simple mechanism to create discussions and vote, also you have some models available to select in order to reach different types of results.

To know more about models and how to create your own models read our wiki [here](https://github.com/2kodevs/matcom_scheduler/wiki/model). Also if you don't know a running instance of the bot, you can read how to set-up your own [here](https://github.com/2kodevs/matcom_scheduler/wiki/Setting-up).


## Execution
If you want to run your bot and you are done with the [set-up](https://github.com/2kodevs/matcom_scheduler/wiki/Setting-up), the execute:
```
make run
```
If you don't have `make` in your system just use:
```
python main.py
```
Also check the command help, to know about their available arguments
```
pyhton main.py --help
```

## Customization
If you feel that the models are not fulfilling your excpectations, then you can read about how to create and use your own models [here](https://github.com/2kodevs/matcom_scheduler/wiki/adding-models)

Also you can personalize your bot, and again to know how to do that we recommend you to read our [wiki](https://github.com/2kodevs/matcom_scheduler/wiki/Bot-Personalization)
